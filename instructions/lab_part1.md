## Instructions

### Step 0: What is a Threat Intelligence Feed?

In the Splunk Fundamentals lab, you searched log data that was already in your SIEM. But where does the knowledge of *what to look for* come from? That's where **threat intelligence** enters the picture.

Threat intelligence feeds are continuous or periodic streams of information about known threats — malicious IP addresses, suspicious domains, file hashes associated with malware, and more. Organizations that detect attacks share what they found so others can defend against the same threats. In a real SOC, analysts integrate these feeds into their SIEM so searches can automatically flag activity that matches known bad actors.

  <summary>What types of threat feeds exist?</summary>

  Feeds vary widely depending on their source and purpose:

  - **IP reputation lists** — known malicious or suspicious IP addresses
  - **Domain blocklists** — domains associated with phishing, malware distribution, or C2 infrastructure
  - **File hash feeds** — MD5/SHA hashes of known malicious files
  - **Vulnerability feeds** — newly disclosed CVEs and affected software versions
  - **Sector-specific feeds** — some feeds are shared only within an industry (healthcare, finance, government)

  Some feeds update continuously in real time; others are static snapshots. In this lab we'll work with a **static feed** — ideal for learning how to ingest and query intelligence data.

  <summary>Why does this matter for a SOC analyst?</summary>

  Threat feeds let you stop searching blindly and start searching purposefully. Instead of asking "is anything weird happening?", you can ask "has any activity on our network matched a known bad actor?" That's a much more actionable question — and it's one your SIEM can answer automatically once the feed is loaded.

### Step 1: Download the Threat Feed

For this lab, we'll work with a feed of IP addresses associated with the **Tor network** — an anonymizing network often used by privacy-conscious users, but also by threat actors trying to hide the origin of attacks.

- [ ] Download the threat feed file to your computer:
  **[IOCs_Tor.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codepath/cyb102-file-storage/main/threat-hunt/IOCs_Tor.csv)**
  *(Right-click the link and choose "Save link as..." to download the file as a .csv - it will default to .txt)*

### Step 2: Upload the Feed to Splunk

> [!NOTE]
> If you're resuming a previous session, this file may already be in Splunk. Run the search below with **All Time** selected before uploading — if the count is 0, proceed with the upload. Otherwise, skip ahead to Step 3.
>
> ```SPL
> source="IOCs_Tor.csv" | stats count
> ```

Unlike the Splunk Fundamentals lab, this one has no pre-loaded data. That's intentional. SOC analysts import new threat feeds into their SIEM all the time, and this upload workflow is what that looks like in practice.

- [ ] In Splunk, navigate to **Settings** → **Add Data**.
- [ ] Click **Upload** (the option for uploading files from your computer).
- [ ] Click **Select File** and choose the `IOCs_Tor.csv` file you downloaded.
- [ ] Click **Next**.

#### Source Type

Splunk needs to know how to parse the file. Since this is a CSV:

- [ ] In the **Set Source Type** step, confirm the source type is set to **csv**. Splunk may auto-detect this — if so, you'll see a preview of the parsed fields. If not, search for and select `csv` manually.
- [ ] Click **Next**.

#### Input Settings

This screen lets you control how Splunk labels the incoming data.

- [ ] Find the **Host** field. Change the value from the default (usually the filename) to **`Threat Feed`**.
  - This makes it easy to distinguish threat intelligence data from operational logs when searching.
- [ ] Leave all other settings at their defaults.
- [ ] Click **Review**, then **Submit**.

🎯 **Checkpoint 1**: Splunk should confirm the upload succeeded. Click **Start Searching** to go directly to the Search & Reporting app.

### Step 3: Explore the Feed

Let's see what we're working with.

- [ ] Run the following search with **All Time** selected:

  ```SPL
  source="IOCs_Tor.csv"
  ```

- [ ] Expand a few events and browse the **Interesting Fields** panel on the left.

You should see fields including `Order` and `IP Address` — these are the columns from the CSV, parsed as searchable fields. The raw feed contains only IP addresses, so there's no `Country` field yet. You'll derive geographic details like country in the next step using Splunk's `iplocation` command.

> [!NOTE]
> Field names that contain spaces (like `IP Address`) must be quoted in SPL searches: `"IP Address"`. You'll see this pattern throughout this lab.

- [ ] How many events (IP addresses) are in this feed? Note the count — you'll reference it later.

- [ ] Try a few searches to explore the data:

> [!TIP]
> If these return 0 results, switch the search mode from **Smart** to **Verbose** using the dropdown next to the search bar. Smart mode sometimes skips field extraction for exploratory searches.

  - Which countries have the most Tor exit nodes? Run:

    ```SPL
    source="IOCs_Tor.csv" | iplocation "IP Address" | stats count by Country | sort -count
    ```

    The feed only stores IP addresses, so `Country` isn't in the data yet. Splunk's `iplocation` command enriches each event by looking up its IP address and adding geographic fields such as `Country`, `City`, and `Region` at search time. Once `iplocation` has run, `stats count by Country` can group on that derived field.
  - Are any IP addresses duplicated in the feed?

🎯 **Checkpoint 2**: You should have a working sense of what the Tor feed contains — a list of known Tor network IP addresses with associated metadata.

### Step 4: Why Does Tor Activity Matter?

You now have a list of known Tor IP addresses in your SIEM. On its own, that's just reference data. The power comes from **cross-referencing it against your own network logs** — which is exactly what we'll do in [Part 2](./lab_part2.md).

> [!TIP]
> The Tor feed is a simple example of threat intelligence. In a production environment, you'd also ingest feeds covering malware C2 infrastructure, phishing domains, and attacker infrastructure — all searchable the same way.

You've completed Part 1! In [Part 2](./lab_part2.md), you'll bring in network proxy logs and build a search that finds any Tor activity on your network.
